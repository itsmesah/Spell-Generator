# Spell-Generator
A Discord bot written in Python that will randomly generate a spell and its description through the command ' /spell'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bot key is not included in the 'key' text file so for any usage, a bot key aquired by the user 
will need to replace the text: "ADD YOUR BOT KEY HERE".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be updated as the author of this program writes out the encryption of their own bot key
within the program as to contribute to the security of the original bot's token and to save public 
users of this program an extra step in the near future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUGE thanks to Brandon and his help developing the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future update to this Discord Bot will include embedded gifs from the 
movie series that will accompany the name of the spell plus the description.
